# Brief Biography
I am currently an assitant professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.indiana.edu/) at Indiana University at Bloomington. I received my Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University. My research interests include machine learning, numerical optimzation, Bayesian methods, graph theory, and their applications in computational biology. 

# To prospective Ph.D. students
I am recruiting for graduate students. Research Assistantship (RA) positions will be offered to outstanding students who are hard-working and motivated. Interested candidates should email their CVs, transcripts, and brief research statements.
[Note] I apologize but I may not have time to reply to all the inquiry emails. However, I do reply to the students who have applied for admissions to our department if you have all the requested documents in your inquiry emails.
